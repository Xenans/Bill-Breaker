# Bill-Breaker

Splitting the bill after a long night out can be an arduous affair, particularly when the responsibility falls to the person who paid. Fear no more! Bill Breaker is here to make that process as easy as possible, greatly simplifying the process of identifying the amount each person owes and processing the receipt for those less technologically inclined.
